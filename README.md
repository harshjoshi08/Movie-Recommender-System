# 🎬 Movie Recommender System Project

This repository showcases an end-to-end **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** built using Python. The project covers all phases from data preprocessing to deployment on Heroku.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Comprehensive Pipeline**: From data collection to model building, web integration, and deployment.
- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on textual similarity (genres, keywords, cast, etc.).
- 🛠️ **Built with Machine Learning**: Utilizes vectorization and cosine similarity to match user-selected movies with similar ones.
- 🌐 **Web Deployment**: The application is deployed using **Heroku**, making it accessible online.
- 📊 **Real-World Use Cases**: Recommender systems like this are used by Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Spotify, and more.

## 🧠 Techniques Covered

- Text preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training (similarity-based)
- Flask web integration
- Heroku deployment

## 🧱 Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**: Movie metadata is acquired from TMDB or similar APIs.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Text vectorization using `CountVectorizer`
   - Similarity computation using `cosine_similarity`
3. **Web Interface**: Built with **Flask**, allowing users to choose a movie and view recommended similar ones.
4. **Deployment**: Hosted on **Heroku** for public access.
